=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object is used to describe an Amazon EBS volume. It is returned
by VM::EC2->describe_volumes().

=head1 METHODS

The following object methods are supported:
 
 volumeId         -- ID of this volume.
 size             -- Size of this volume (in GB).
 snapshotId       -- ID of snapshot this 
 availabilityZone -- Availability zone in which this volume resides.
 status           -- Volume state, one of "creating", "available",
                     "in-use", "deleting", "deleted", "error"
 createTime       -- Timestamp for when volume was created.
 tags             -- Hashref containing tags associated with this group.
                     See L<VM::EC2::Generic>.

In addition, this class provides several convenience functions:

=head2 $attachment  = $vol->attachment

=head2 @attachments = $vol->attachments

The attachment() method returns a
VM::EC2::BlockDevice::Attachment object describing the
attachment of this volume to an instance. If the volume is unused,
then this returns undef.

The attachments() method is similar, except that it returns a list of
the attachments.  Currently an EBS volume can only be attached to one
instance at a time, but the Amazon call syntax supports multiple
attachments and this method is provided for future compatibility.

=head2 $attachment = $vol->attach($instance,$device)

=head2 $attachment = $vol->attach(-instance_id=>$instance,-device=>$device)

Attach this volume to an instance using virtual device $device. Both
arguments are required. The result is a
VM::EC2::BlockDevice::Attachment object which you can monitor by
calling current_status():

    my $a = $volume->attach('i-12345','/dev/sdg');
    while ($a->current_status ne 'attached') {
       sleep 2;
    }
    print "volume is ready to go\n";

=head2 $attachment = $volume->detach()

=head2 $attachment = $volume->detach(-instance_id=>$instance_id,
                                  -device=>$device,
                                  -force=>$force);

Detaches this volume. With no arguments, will detach the volume from
whatever instance it is currently attached to. Provide -instance_id
and/or -device as a check that you are detaching the volume from the
expected instance and device.

Optional arguments:

 -instance_id    -- ID of the instance to detach from.
 -device         -- How the device is exposed to the instance.
 -force          -- Force detachment, even if previous attempts were
                    unsuccessful.

The result is a VM::EC2::BlockDevice::Attachment object which
you can monitor by calling current_status():

    my $a = $volume->detach;
    while ($a->current_status ne 'detached') {
       sleep 2;
    }
    print "volume is ready to go\n";

=head2 $boolean = $vol->deleteOnTermination([$boolean])

Get or set the deleteOnTermination flag for attached volumes. If the volume 
is unattached, then this causes a fatal error. Called with no arguments, this
method returns the current state of the deleteOnTermination flag for the
volume's attachment. Called with a true/false argument, the method sets the
flag by calling modify_instance_attributes() on the corresponding instance
and returns true if successful.

=head2 $snap = $vol->from_snapshot

Returns the VM::EC2::Snapshot object that this volume was
originally derived from. It will return undef if the resource no
longer exists, or if the volume was created from scratch.

=head2 @snap = $vol->to_snapshots

If this volume has been used to create one or more snapshots, this
method will return them as a list of VM::EC2::Snapshot objects.

=head2 $snapshot = $vol->create_snapshot('Description')

Create a snapshot of the volume and return a VM::EC2::Snapshot
object. To ensure a consistent snapshot, you should unmount the volume
before snapshotting it. The optional argument allows you to add a description to the snapshot.

Here is an example:

  $s = $volume->create_snapshot("Backed up at ".localtime);
  while ($s->current_status eq 'pending') {
     print "Progress: ",$s->progress,"% done\n";
  }
  print "Snapshot status: ",$s->current_status,"\n";

=head2 $status = $vol->current_status

This returns the up-to-date status of the volume. It works by calling
refresh() and then returning status().

=head1 STRING OVERLOADING

When used in a string context, this object will interpolate the
volumeId.
